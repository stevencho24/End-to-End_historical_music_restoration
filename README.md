Official implementation and evaluation resources for **End-to-End Historical Music Restoration in Latent Space**.

This repository studies historical music restoration as conditional flow matching in the continuous latent space of the frozen [SAME-L](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/SAME-L) audio autoencoder. The proposed 40M-parameter model, **SAMECFM**, maps degraded historical-audio latents toward clean musical-audio latents and decodes the restored representation at 44.1 kHz.

> **Release status:** implementation, current paper PDF, interactive demo,
> aggregate subjective results, published test set, and SAMECFM-40M checkpoint
> are included. The arXiv identifier is forthcoming.

## 🚀 Quickstart: restore one file

Python 3.11 and an NVIDIA GPU are recommended. Accept the
[SAME-L license](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/SAME-L), then run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stevencho24/End-to-End_historical_music_restoration.git
cd End-to-End_historical_music_restoration
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e .
bash prepare_data.sh
scripts/infer_samecfm40_fos.sh path/to/input.wav output/restored
```

`prepare_data.sh` downloads the v1.0.0 paper checkpoint, resumes interrupted
downloads, and verifies its SHA-256. The restored WAV is written below
`output/restored/`. SAME-L downloads automatically on first use.

| Goal | Command |
|---|---|
| Restore a file or directory | `scripts/infer_samecfm40_fos.sh INPUT OUTPUT_DIR` |
| Build the training cache | `python main.py precompute ...` |
| Train on one GPU | `scripts/train_samecfm40_fos.sh` |
| Reproduce the paper launch on four GPUs | `scripts/train_samecfm40_fos_4gpu.sh` |

## 🧠 Method

```text
historical audio -> frozen SAME-L encoder -> degraded latent
                                                |
                                      conditional flow matching
                                      1-D DiT velocity network
                                                |
clean estimate  <- frozen SAME-L decoder <- restored latent
```

The principal training configuration uses:

- Full-Orchestra recordings plus instrumental sections, denoted Full-Orchestra + Section (FOS);
- a leak-free song-level train/validation split;
- five-second, 44.1-kHz training windows;
- whole-song loudness normalization before windowing;
- a five-stage historical-recording degradation model;
- a 40M-parameter conditional flow-matching DiT in SAME-L space.

The CFM follows the straight path from unit Gaussian noise to the clean
normalized latent and minimizes velocity MSE in latent space. Per-channel
SAME-L statistics are essential: they prevent high-variance channels from
dominating the objective and keep the target scale compatible with the
Gaussian source. Latents must be unnormalized before the frozen SAME-L
decoder; omitting that step causes a large quality loss. Mel-spectrogram MSE
is used for analysis, not to train SAMECFM-40M.

### Synthetic historical degradation

Every clean training window passes through the same ordered five-stage chain;
there is no probability gating. Gaussian draws are clipped to the stated
ranges. The main five-stage contribution is implemented in
[`restor/corruption.py`](restor/corruption.py); all sampled parameter
distributions are in
[`config/samecfm40_fos.yaml`](config/samecfm40_fos.yaml).

| Stage | Operation | Sampling parameters |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Zero-phase EQ 1 | Nodes: 40, 80, 160, 320, 640, 1280, 2560, 5120, 10240, 20480 Hz; mean gains: −9.0, −4.9, −4.9, 0.0, 0.0, −3.1, −1.1, −8.6, −2.1, 0.0 dB; independent standard deviation 14.7 dB; clipped to [−80, 0] dB |
| 2 | Scaled-tanh nonlinearity | Drive `a ~ N(2.2, 0.9)`, clipped to [0.75, 4.5]; wet mix `w ~ N(0.18, 0.09)`, clipped to [0.03, 0.40]; `y=(1−w)x+w tanh(ax)/a` |
| 3 | Zero-phase EQ 2 | Same nodes, standard deviation, and clipping as EQ 1; mean gains: −3.0, −4.9, −4.9, 0.0, 0.0, −3.1, −1.1, −8.6, −2.1, 0.0 dB |
| 4 | Smooth band-pass | Low cutoff `N(100,50)` Hz clipped to [40,250]; high cutoff `N(3200,850)` Hz clipped to [2000,5500]; low slope `N(18,8)` dB/oct clipped to [6,48]; high slope `N(30,10)` dB/oct clipped to [12,60] |
| 5 | Real gramophone surface noise | Random segment from the Gramophone Record Noise Dataset; SNR `N(11,4.5)` dB clipped to [2,20] dB |

Stage 5 uses Eloi Moliner's
[Gramophone Record Noise Dataset](http://research.spa.aalto.fi/publications/papers/icassp22-denoising/media/datasets/Gramophone_Record_Noise_Dataset.zip),
linked by its
[official source repository](https://github.com/eloimoliner/denoising-historical-recordings).
Download it with `scripts/download_gramophone_noise.sh`, then pass its output
directory to `main.py precompute --noise-dir`.

The two EQ curves are independently sampled and use log-frequency
interpolation. They form a Wiener–Hammerstein sequence around the static
nonlinearity. Filtering is zero phase to retain temporal alignment between
each degraded input and its clean target. White-noise augmentation is not used.

No private listening-test responses, credentials, training data, inference corpora, or model checkpoints are stored in this repository.

## 🎧 Demo

The static site under [`demo/`](demo/) contains six synchronized historical comparisons, the method diagram, and aggregate subjective results. Run it locally with Node.js 22:

```bash
cd demo
npm ci
npm run dev
```

For Vercel, import this repository and set the project **Root Directory** to `demo`. No server, environment variables, or runtime inference are required.

## 🎛️ Inference options

The launcher accepts one file or recursively processes a directory. It uses the
paper settings: ten uniform Euler steps, CFG 1.0, and seed 42. Override
`CHECKPOINT`, `DEVICE`, `CFM_STEPS`, `SEED`, `CHUNK_SEC`, or `OVERLAP`
with environment variables. Arbitrary-length input is converted to 44.1-kHz
mono and processed with overlap-add.

The checkpoint is also available on the
[v1.0.0 release page](https://github.com/stevencho24/End-to-End_historical_music_restoration/releases/tag/v1.0.0).
Its expected SHA-256 is
`2b13d250a66e3c640a52d3b5969951fd6d7a1336b5b5bd97770b28c5707f7ae3`.

## 🧪 Precompute training pairs

Put clean 44.1-kHz WAV files in one directory. Then download the stage-5 noise
dataset (about 1.2 GB) and build the cache:

```bash
scripts/download_gramophone_noise.sh

python main.py precompute \
  --source-dir data/public_classical_orchestral_plus_sections \
  --manifest data/public_classical_orchestral_plus_sections/MANIFEST.tsv \
  --noise-dir data/gramophone_record_noise \
  --output-root data/fos_precomputed
```

The command requires one CUDA GPU and writes `train/`, `validate/`, and
`ground_truth/`. Omit `--manifest` for unrelated files; use it to keep
aligned full-mix and section views in the same song-level split. See
[`docs/precompute.md`](docs/precompute.md) for its simple TSV schema and all
defaults.

## 🏋️ Train

The default launcher is one-GPU friendly and starts with batch size 4:

```bash
scripts/train_samecfm40_fos.sh
```

To initialize a new run from the downloaded paper weights:

```bash
INIT_CHECKPOINT=checkpoints/samecfm_40m_fos.pt \
scripts/train_samecfm40_fos.sh
```

Use `BATCH_SIZE=1` if GPU memory is limited, `RESUME=1` to continue the
latest checkpoint from the same experiment, or set `NPROC_PER_NODE` and
`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` for multiple GPUs. The exact paper launch remains:

```bash
scripts/train_samecfm40_fos_4gpu.sh
```

The downloadable checkpoint initializes the model and EMA for a new optimizer
run. It is not an optimizer-level resume checkpoint. The published Zenodo
archive below is an unpaired evaluation set, not training data.

## 📊 Evaluation

The paper evaluates restoration on:

- an unpaired historical Internet Archive test set split into Full-Orchestra and Light Orchestra;
- a synthetic paired test set with aligned clean references;
- objective perceptual, spectral, embedding-distribution, embedding-similarity, and fidelity metrics;
- MOS-Quality and reference-based MOS-Preservation listening tests.

Aggregate subjective results are provided under [`results/`](results/). The sensitivity-analysis folder retains listeners whose mean score over four clean ground-truth quality items is at least 4. Individual listener data are intentionally excluded.

## 💿 Dataset

The published historical unpaired test set contains 149 full-length recordings totaling **9.30 hours**: 70 Full-Orchestra and 79 Light Orchestra items. It is available from Zenodo at DOI [`10.5281/zenodo.22737610`](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.22737610).

Download, verify, and unpack it under the directory name expected by the
public inference launcher:

```bash
scripts/download_zenodo_test_set.sh data/historical_unpaired_test
scripts/infer_samecfm40_fos.sh \
  data/historical_unpaired_test \
  output/zenodo_samecfm40_fos
```

The downloader fetches the official `audio_orchestra_70.zip`,
`audio_light_orchestra_79.zip`, metadata, rights, and checksum files directly
from Zenodo record 22737610 and checks the published SHA-256 values before
unpacking. A different input dataset may be substituted in the second command.

## 🔊 Checkpoints and audio demos

The small public listening examples are already bundled in [`demo/`](demo/),
so a separate `examples/` directory is unnecessary. The model weight is a
versioned GitHub Release asset rather than part of ordinary Git history.

## ⚠️ Limitations

- The system is designed for instrumental historical classical recordings represented by the paper's training degradations.
- Restoration quality may decline for degradations or musical domains outside the training distribution.
- SAME-L licensing is separate from this repository's MIT-licensed code.
- Generative restoration can alter fine musical details; restored audio should not be treated as an archival ground-truth reconstruction.
